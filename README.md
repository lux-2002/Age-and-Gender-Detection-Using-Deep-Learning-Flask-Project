# Age-and-Gender-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Flask-Project
Deep Learning has found huge applications in the field of Computer vision. Some of the 
most important applications of computer vision are in the fields that deal with facial data. 
Face Detection and recognition are being widely used in security-based applications. 
 
In this guided project, we are going to talk about two of the most important applications 
of face-based deep learning, age, and gender prediction from a facial image. 
 
To build this project we will be using an OpenCV and Caffe model where the weights will 
be taken from pre-trained models each for facial detection, age, and gender. The prediction 
will result on a real-time basis as well as on a manual basis.
